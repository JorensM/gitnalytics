Post description:

Gitnalytics is a small analytics tool that lets you integrate your version
control system (git) with an analytics platform such as Google Analytics.

It lets you map your commit history to your analytics data such as pageviews, 
so you can track and measure the impact of your product updates in respect
to your user stats.

Right now the tool is in early MVP stage and open for beta testing. If you'd
like to become a tester please DM me.

Currently the price is 8 euro per month with a free 14 day trial.

If you'd like to check out the tool, link is in the bio.
